Memory Cards game made with a few YouTube tutorials (Unity v. 2019.3.14).

- There are 16 cards, turned up with the backside.
- You need to find pairs for them by turning them over and remembering their location.
- There are characters from the game "Stronghold Crusades" on the front side of images (suddenly it's important).
- If the player guesses a pair, both cards disappear.
- If the player chooses different images, both cards are turned back.
- The game ends when there are no cards left on the table.

Sure that the code could better, and we no need 2 scripts, but for now this is my Frankenstein.
Thank you for your time and have a nice day. :)
